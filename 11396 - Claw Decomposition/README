A claw is defined as a pointed curved nail on the end of each toe in birds, some
reptiles, and some mammals. However, if you are a graph theory enthusiast, you
may understand the following special class of graph as shown in the following
figure by the word claw.

If you are more concerned about graph theory terminology, you may want to
define claw as K1,3.

Lets leave the definition for the moment and come to the problem. You are
given a simple undirected graph in which every vertex has degree 3. You are to
figure out whether the graph can be decomposed into claws or not.
Just for the sake of clarity, a decomposition of a graph is a list of subgraphs such that each edge
appears in exactly one subgraph in the list.

Input
There will be several cases in the input file. Each case starts with the number of vertices in the graph,
V (4 ≤ V ≤ 300). This is followed by a list of edges. Every line in the list has two integers, a and b,
the endpoints of an edge (1 ≤ a, b ≤ V ). The edge list ends with a line with a pair of ‘0’. The end of
input is denoted by a case with V = 0. This case should not be processed.

Output
For every case in the input, print ‘YES’ if the graph can be decomposed into claws and ‘NO’ otherwise.
